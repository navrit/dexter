*  Define a BRAM map for the AHBROM memory space. The
*  address space 0x0000 - 0x0fff, 4 KB (=1 Kwords 32 bits wide).
*  Run ISE Translate -> "Floorplan Area/IO/Logic (PlanAhead)" once (without this BMM file
*  attached to the ISE Project) to find out that there are 16 ramloops and each RAMB18E1
*  is configured as 36K? x 2 bit
*  Note: *THE RAMLOOP ORDER IS VERY IMPORTANT!!!*
*        Define ramloop 15 downto 0 and databits 31 downto 0 !!! Otherwise the memory
*        content will be swapped and the program fails to execute. Aperently the ramloop
*        number and bit definitions are not read by data2mem.
