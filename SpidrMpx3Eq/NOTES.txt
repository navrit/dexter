BUGS & ISSUES:
DONE 2015-04-15 -Decode frames not properly set from JSON
-Generated data + load data leaves old data.
-No pixels fired/total charge(/pixels masked)
DONE 2015-04-11, Was mostly an issue with the way histograms were loaded not, textures loaded. -Loading is slow on AMD cards, upload all frames at once not frame by frame.
DONE 2015-04-11-Heatmap is the wrong way around before switching
    DONE 2015-04-11-Heatmap is the wrong way around for Opengl.
-Get frames reimplemnt
-Histograms on multidisplays

-segfault in histogram when summing? Could not reproduce.
-Clear data segfaults?

TODO:
-Add a log display?
-Sampling (s) not connected?
PARTIALLY DONE 2015-04-17, CAN'T FIND DEFINITION OF OPERATION MODE -Gainmode/operationMode  etc. as combobox (see glVisualization)
DONE 2015-04-17- BUGGY'ISH Histogram, full range, percentile (median, spread), manual range.
DONE 2015-04-14 multidisplay, STILL BUGGY. Implement with opengl rotation instead?
DONE 2015-04-15 Store and load config from file
    DONE 2015-04-17 -Allow for seperate loading of config DACs and other config.
    DONE 2015-04-17 -Automatically append .json
PARTIALLY DONE 2015-04-17, REQUIRES JOHN'S ATTENTION -Propagate data to  Spidr
DONE 2015-04-17 -Ip address as spinbox
-Only load a single frame at a time in glplot.
-Look at terminal output (shows more errors), remove all errors.

-Controls on gradient widget
-Clean up code.
   ->Optimize/clean the gl renderer.
   ->Move connection/data taking stuff to Mpx3GUI
   ->Move loading/saving into Dataset
   (->Document code, seperate events, slots, normal functions etc.)
   (->Apply consistent anming scheme)
-Finish voxels.
   ->Lighting, Normal components
   ->Compute voxels with MC.

OBSERVATIONS & QUESTIONS:
-Sr90 data shows a connected structure, is this because of a lack of colimator? NO, electron movement in silicon, Sr90 is a beta source.
